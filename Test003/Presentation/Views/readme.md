# Views Overview

## What are Views?

Views are HTML templates with embedded Razor markup that represent the user interface of your application [[4]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/overview?view=aspnetcore-9.0). They are responsible for presenting data to users in a visually appealing and interactive manner [[1]](https://medium.com/@rubenghosh968/understanding-asp-net-mvc-an-overview-7168ce7b912a).

## Key Concepts

1. **Razor Syntax**
    - Razor is a markup syntax that enables embedding server-side code into web pages
    - Uses the `@` symbol to transition from HTML to C#
    - Allows dynamic content generation

2. **View Models**
    - Dedicated classes that contain data specifically needed by views
    - Helps maintain separation of concerns
    - Typically placed in a `ViewModels` folder [[6]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/664205/viewmodel-best-practices)

3. **Layout Pages**
    - Define a common structure for your application
    - Contains shared elements like headers, footers, and navigation
    - Individual views are rendered within the layout template

## Best Practices

1. **Data Management**
    - Implement caching for better performance
    - Use ViewModels to transfer data between controllers and views
    - Avoid putting business logic in views [[3]](https://www.c-metric.com/blog/best-practices-of-asp-net-mvc-development/)

2. **Code Organization**
    - Keep views lightweight and focused on presentation
    - Use partial views for reusable UI components
    - Implement HTML Helpers for common markup patterns [[2]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/views/asp-net-mvc-views-overview-cs
