# Web API Overview

## Introduction

Web API in ASP.NET MVC is a framework for building HTTP services that can be accessed by various clients, including browsers, mobile devices, and desktop applications. It's designed to create RESTful services using the .NET Framework.

## Key Concepts

### 1. RESTful Architecture
- Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Resource-based URLs
- Stateless communication
- Supports multiple data formats (JSON, XML)

### 2. Core Components
- **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests
- **Routes**: Define URL patterns for API endpoints
- **Models**: Represent data structures
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Shape data for API responses

## Best Practices

### 1. API Design
- Use proper HTTP methods for operations
- Implement consistent naming conventions
- Design resource-oriented URLs
- Include proper error handling
- Support pagination for large datasets

### 2. Architecture
- Implement clean architecture principles
- Separate business logic from controllers
- Use dependency injection
- Implement
