# Domain Layer

This layer contains enterprise business rules and entities. It represents the core business logic independent of application specifics.

## Purpose

The domain layer:
- Defines enterprise-wide business rules
- Contains business entities and value objects
- Implements domain logic and validation
- Remains completely isolated from other layers

## Structure

```
domain/
├── entities/       # Business entities
├── value-objects/ # Value objects
├── events/        # Domain events
├── repositories/  # Repository interfaces
└── services/      # Domain services
```

## Guidelines

1. Should be pure TypeScript with no external dependencies
2. Contains enterprise-wide business rules
3. Does not depend on any other layer
4. Should not be affected by changes to other layers
