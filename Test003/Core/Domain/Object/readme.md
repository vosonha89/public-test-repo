# Domain Objects

This directory contains the core domain objects that represent the fundamental business entities and value objects in the system. These objects encapsulate business rules and behavior, forming the heart of the domain model.

## Purpose

Domain objects serve to:
- Model real-world business concepts and relationships
- Encapsulate business logic and validation rules
- Provide a ubiquitous language shared between developers and domain experts
- Ensure business rule consistency across the application

## Types of Domain Objects

### Entities

Entities are objects that have an identity and are tracked through their lifecycle:
- Have a unique identifier
- Can change their attributes while maintaining the same identity
- Are mutable and have a state that changes over time
- Represent business objects with continuity and identity

### Value Objects

Value objects describe characteristics of things:
- Have no identity of their own
- Are immutable once created
- Are compared based on their attributes rather than identity
- Can be freely replaced when changed

### Aggregates

Aggregates are clusters of related entities and value objects:
- Have a root entity (aggregate root)
- Maintain consistency boundaries
- Are accessed only through the aggregate root
- Protect invariants across multiple objects

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Rich Domain Model**: Encapsulate business logic within domain objects rather than in services
2. **Immutability**: Make value objects immutable to prevent unexpected side effects
3. **Validation**: Include self-validation logic to ensure objects remain in a valid state
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Avoid dependencies on infrastructure or application layers
5. **Domain Events**: Use domain events to communicate significant state changes

## Best Practices

- Focus on behavior over data structures
- Use meaningful and expressive naming aligned with domain terminology
- Apply encapsulation to hide implementation details
- Maintain invariants through well-defined constructors and methods
- Consider using factory methods for complex object creation

When implementing domain objects, always refer to the domain experts for guidance on business rules and behavior to ensure the model accurately reflects the business domain.
