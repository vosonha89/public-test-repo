# Application Services

This directory contains service implementations that orchestrate business operations and use cases in the application.

## Purpose

Application services:
- Execute use cases and business operations
- Coordinate between different domain objects
- Transform data between layers using DTOs
- Maintain transaction boundaries

## Structure

```

├── auth/           # Authentication related services

## Service Guidelines

1. **Service Responsibility**
    - One service class per use case or related use cases
    - Handle input validation and sanitization
    - Transform DTOs to domain objects and vice versa
    - Coordinate work between multiple repositories

2. **Method Naming**
    - Use verb-noun combinations (e.g., createUser, updateProfile)
    - Be specific about the operation
    - Reflect business terminology
    - Include return type in name when necessary

3. **Error Handling**
    - Throw specific application exceptions
    - Handle domain exceptions appropriately
    - Include meaningful error messages
    - Preserve stack traces
