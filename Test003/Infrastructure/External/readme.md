# External Adapters

This directory contains implementations of external service adapters that connect our application to third-party services and infrastructure components.

## Purpose

External adapters translate between our application's internal interfaces and external services, following the Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal) architecture pattern.

## Structure

```
external/
├── database/          # Database adapters (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
├── payment/           # Payment service adapters (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
├── logging/          # Logging service adapters (Winston, Pino, etc.)
├── monitoring/       # Monitoring adapters (Prometheus, New Relic, etc.)
└── messaging/        # Message queue adapters (RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.)
```

## Guidelines

1. Each adapter should implement an interface defined in the application layer
2. Adapters should handle all the specifics of external service interaction
3. Error handling should translate external errors to application-specific errors
4. Configuration should be injected through the constructor
5. Use dependency injection for better testability

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each adapter should be isolated and not depend on other adapters
2. **Error Handling**: Properly handle and transform external service errors
3. **Logging**: Include comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
4. **Configuration**: Use environment variables for external service configuration
5. **Testing**: Include mock implementations for testing
6. **Documentation**: Document configuration requirements and usage examples

## Configuration Management

- Use environment variables for sensitive data and configuration
- Implement configuration validation
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type-safe configuration
- Centralize configuration management
- Document all required environment variables
